# RegulTermAnalyzer
RegulTermAnalyzer is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model designed to quickly check and analyze keyword and theme frequencies within regulatory documents from different countries. This tool enables users to track notable trends in regulatory focus and interest, making it valuable for researchers, regulatory bodies, and industry professionals seeking insights into evolving regulatory landscapes.

Features
Keyword Frequency Analysis: Identify the frequency of specific terms in regulatory texts from various countries.
Cross-Country Comparison: Easily compare term and theme occurrences across multiple countries to identify similarities and differences.

Background
As global regulatory frameworks evolve, understanding regional differences in terminology and focus is essential. For instance, the term "real world evidence" has seen increased usage in the United States, reflecting a shift in regulatory priorities. This tool allows users to uncover such trends and provides insights into regulatory approaches in the USA, EU, China, and other regions.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To use RegulTermAnalyzer, you'll need:

Python 3.8+
Pandas: For data manipulation
Matplotlib: For visualization
NLTK or SpaCy: For NLP tasks (optional, depending on the extent of text processing)
Any additional libraries required are listed in the requirements.txt file.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RegulTermAnalyzer.git
cd RegulTermAnalyzer
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Load Your Data: Prepare your regulatory documents in CSV format with columns for country, year, and text.

Run the Analysis: Use the main.py script to perform term and theme frequency analysis. For example:

bash
Copy code
python main.py --term "real world evidence"
You can also specify additional parameters, such as the country or time period:

bash
Copy code
python main.py --term "real world evidence" --country "USA" --start_year 2010 --end_year 2024
Visualize Trends: The script will generate bar and line charts that illustrate the frequency and trends of the selected terms across countries and over time.

Example Output
As illustrated in the example below, RegulTermAnalyzer can reveal trends such as a peak in the term "real world evidence" in the USA in 2022, corresponding with the country's integration of this concept into regulatory practices.
